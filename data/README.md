# Borehole data

Directory for processing borehole hydraulic head measurements. The borehole drilling campaign is described by Meierbachtol et al. (2013) and the data are summarized by Wright et al. (2016). The raw data are not reproduced here. Processed (daily mean) data are in the `processed/` directory.
